# ArFleet Genesis Pass

The ArFleet Genesis Pass is a crucial component for participating in the ArFleet testnet. Currently, only individuals possessing an ArFleet Genesis Pass can function as providers or clients within the testnet.

## Distribution

As part of our initial launch, we distributed 3 passes to each attendee of the ArFleet Genesis event. This distribution was designed to kickstart our community and provide early adopters with the means to engage with the platform.

## Tradability

The ArFleet Genesis Passes are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that can be traded on the Arweave network. If you're interested in acquiring a pass, you can find them on the Bazar marketplace:

## How to Use Your Pass

To utilize your ArFleet Genesis Pass:

1. Start the ArFleet client application.
2. Locate your client address, which will be displayed upon startup.
3. Transfer one of your ArFleet Genesis Passes to this client address.

Once the transfer is complete, you'll be able to fully participate in the ArFleet testnet as either a provider or a client.
