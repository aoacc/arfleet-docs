# Provider Setup

Thank you for your interest in participating in ArFleet Testnet as a provider.

There will be more detailed information about the provider setup here.

In the meantime, you can use the same instructions as [ArFleet-JS](/docs/use-arfleet/arfleet-js/use-arfleet-js), with the only difference that you will need to:

- Instead of `./arfleet client` command, use `./arfleet provider`
- After the provider starts, type in `announce` to announce your services to the network

:::info
You will need [ArFleet Genesis Pass](/docs/use-arfleet/arfleet-pass) attached to the provider's wallet, and an external IP address that ArFleet clients can connect to.
