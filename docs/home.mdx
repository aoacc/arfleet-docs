## What is ArFleet?

ArFleet is a protocol designed to facilitate the purchase of time-limited data storage from permissionless peers, eliminating the requirement of a third-party for enforcement.

This proposed framework operates within the ao compute environment.

## How is ArFleet different from Arweave?

[Arweave](https://arweave.org) provides permanent storage for the permaweb.

[ArFleet](https://arfleet.io) complements this by providing a mechanism for temporary, on-demand data storage. This combination allows users to choose between long-term preservation and flexible, time-limited storage options, enhancing the overall utility of decentralized data management.
